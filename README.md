# ðŸ“Š ML Model Performance Comparison Dashboard

This project demonstrates how to evaluate and visualize the performance of multiple machine learning models using Python and Power BI. By training several classification algorithms on the Telco Customer Churn dataset, I extract key performance metrics and build an interactive dashboard to compare them side-by-side.


## ðŸš€ Objective

The goal of this project is to:

- Train and evaluate popular ML models on a real-world tabular dataset
- Extract metrics like Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score, AUC, and Training Time
- Present the comparison visually in an interactive Power BI dashboard
- Help identify which model performs best under different evaluation criteria

## ðŸ§  Models Compared

- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- XGBoost
- LightGBM
- CatBoost
- MLP Classifier (Neural Network)


## ðŸ“ˆ Metrics Visualized

| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Accuracy** | Overall correctness of predictions |
| **Precision** | Correctness of positive predictions |
| **Recall** | Coverage of actual positives |
| **F1 Score** | Balance of Precision & Recall |
| **ROC AUC** | Area under the ROC curve |
| **Training Time (s)** | Time taken to train each model |
